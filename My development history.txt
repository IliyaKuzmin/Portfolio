This assembly of files is the history of my development as a developer:
All files inserted into the site builder, in which there is no possibility to upload files to the server, therefore have a monolithic organization (CSS|HTML|JS in one file)
My first project.html - the very first code collected for the site.
Multifunction calculator for matrix 22 arcans.html - a transitional moment, a change in the architecture of the program executed in the calculator: script => engine
My first project(support).html is the latest version of the code after a year of practicing CSS and JS.
